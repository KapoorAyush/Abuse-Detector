Used a library better_profanity to detect abusive words in a message. However, training a model on a dataset would have been better but due to time constraint and being a weekday, could not allot much time to this. 
Application returns an alert whether the message has abusive content or the message is safe.
For backend - Python/Flask
Frontend- Simple HTML,CSS and a bit of React.
